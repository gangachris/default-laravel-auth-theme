### Laravel Auth Theme Test
This repo is an exact replica of laravel 5.2 auth views generated when you run this in the command line.
```bash
$ php artisan make:auth
```

The repo provides a basic structure of the auth files, so that anyone can create a template of this type, and use the [Laravel Auth Theme](https://github.com/gangachris/laravel-auth-themes) package to get a an awesome auth theme, by simply running.

```bash
$ php artisan auth:theme https://github.com/gangachris/default-laravel-auth-theme.git
```
